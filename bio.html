<main>
	<p>I consider myself to have an exceptional eye for Art, though I am not quite as exceptional with my life. I was blessed with an average childhood, left school at the awkward age of sixteen, cursed with less than average qualifications and then haggled my way into a rather beige college.</p>
	<p>I chose to study Fine Art, in which I had shown definite potential. I then fashionably retired from the course several months later, diagnosing myself as suffering excruciatingly from a premature mid-life crisis... An event not to be interpreted daintily.</p>
	<p>Ever since then I have become a lone wanderer of the world, a silent hero, As a struggling Artist, and a tormented soul... I urge you to be merciful, by purchasing one of my modestly priced paintings to end my personal recession so that I can buy some Cardigans and take up chain-smokig like a real Artist.</p>
	<p>That is all... Faaanks.</p>
